# Docker Development Environment Implementation

## What Was Built

We've created a comprehensive Docker-based development environment specifically optimized for AI agents to develop and test the SpacetimeDB Kanban application without needing to open a browser.

## Key Components

### 1. Docker Services
- **spacetimedb**: Runs SpacetimeDB with .NET WASI support
- **client**: Node.js dev server with hot reload
- **puppeteer**: Headless Chrome for visual testing

### 2. Visual Testing System
- Built-in scripts for responsive screenshots (all viewports/themes)
- Custom script support for specific test scenarios
- Error logging system accessible to AI agents
- Screenshot output for visual verification

### 3. Claude Code Commands
- `/project:start-dev-env` - Start the entire environment
- `/project:test-visual` - Run visual tests
- `/project:write-visual-test` - Generate test scripts

### 4. Directory Structure
```
docker/
├── dev/                    # Service configurations
├── docker-compose.dev.yml  # Main compose file
├── .env.dev               # Default environment
└── README.md              # Documentation

puppeteer-scripts/         # Custom test scripts
screenshots/               # Visual test output
puppeteer-errors/         # Error logs
```

## Benefits for AI Agents

1. **Visual Verification**: Can "see" UI changes through screenshots
2. **Error Debugging**: Accessible error logs for troubleshooting
3. **Isolation**: Each agent can run their own environment
4. **Consistency**: Same environment for all agents
5. **No Browser Required**: Everything runs headlessly

## Benefits for Humans

1. **Same Tools**: All commands work for humans too
2. **Hot Reload**: See changes instantly
3. **Easy Management**: Simple docker-compose commands
4. **Visual Testing**: Automated screenshot generation

## Usage Example

```bash
# 1. Start environment
/project:start-dev-env

# 2. Make UI changes
# Edit components...

# 3. Test visually
/project:test-visual responsive

# 4. Review results
ls screenshots/
# See: mobile_light_*.png, tablet_dark_*.png, etc.

# 5. Custom testing
cat > puppeteer-scripts/test-my-feature.js << 'EOF'
await page.goto(CLIENT_URL);
// Custom test logic...
EOF

/project:test-visual custom test-my-feature.js
```

## Integration with Worktrees

Each agent working in a worktree can have their own Docker environment:

```bash
cd ../initial-worktrees/agent-theme
cp ../../initial/docker-compose.dev.yml .
docker-compose -p agent-theme up -d
```

This provides complete isolation between agents.

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Environment**: Run `/project:start-dev-env` and verify all services start
2. **Create More Built-in Tests**: Add tests for common UI patterns
3. **Optimize Performance**: Tune Docker resource limits
4. **Add More Commands**: Create commands for common Docker operations
5. **Document Edge Cases**: Add troubleshooting for specific scenarios

## Success Metrics

- ✅ Single command to start everything
- ✅ Visual testing without browser
- ✅ Error logs accessible to agents
- ✅ Hot reload for development
- ✅ Isolated environments for parallel work
- ✅ Works for both AI agents and humans

## Technical Decisions

1. **Why Docker?**: Consistent environment across all platforms
2. **Why Puppeteer?**: Industry standard for headless browser testing
3. **Why Volume Mounts?**: Enable hot reload without rebuilds
4. **Why Separate Services?**: Better resource management and debugging
