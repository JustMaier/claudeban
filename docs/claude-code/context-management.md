## Understanding Context in Claude Code {#understanding-context}

Claude Code operates within a context window - a limited amount of information it can process at once. Effective context management means:

- Providing relevant information without overwhelming
- Structuring data for quick comprehension
- Maintaining consistency across sessions
- Adapting context to current tasks

### Key Principles

1. **Relevance Over Volume**: More context isn't always better
2. **Structure for Scanning**: Use clear headers and formatting
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Layer information by importance
4. **Task-Specific Focus**: Tailor context to current work

## The CLAUDE.md File {#claude-md-file}

The `CLAUDE.md` file serves as the primary context document for AI agents. It should be:

- **Concise**: Essential information only
- **Current**: Regularly updated
- **Actionable**: Focus on what needs doing
- **Navigational**: Point to detailed resources

### Core Structure

```markdown
# Project Name - Agent Instructions

Last Updated: [Date] ([Manual/Auto] - update method)

## <ï¿½ Current Sprint Focus
[1-2 sentences on immediate priorities]

## =ï¿½ Project Status
- **Active Phase**: [Current phase/milestone]
- **Recently Completed**: [Last 3-5 achievements]
- **In Progress**: [Active work items]
- **Available Tasks**: [Next available work]

## =ï¿½ Quick Start
[30-second guide to productivity]

## =ï¿½ Essential Locations
[Key files and directories]

## =ï¿½ Key Commands
[Most-used commands with brief descriptions]

## <ï¿½ What We're Building
[Brief project vision/goals]

## = Development Workflow
[Standard process steps]

## ï¿½ Current Opportunities
[Immediate work available]

## = Quick Links
[References to detailed docs]
```

### Example: SpacetimeDB Kanban CLAUDE.md

The current CLAUDE.md demonstrates effective practices:

1. **Clear Status Section**: Shows exactly what's done, in progress, and available
2. **Quick Start Guide**: Gets agents productive in 30 seconds
3. **Essential Locations**: Points to key resources without duplicating content
4. **Current Focus**: Phase-based development with clear priorities
5. **Command Reference**: Common operations readily available

## Context Window Management {#context-window-management}

### Understanding Limits

Claude Code has a finite context window. Effective management involves:

1. **Prioritization**: Most important information first
2. **Compression**: Summarize verbose content
3. **Reference**: Link to details rather than include them
4. **Rotation**: Swap context based on current task

### Strategies for Large Codebases

#### 1. Modular Context Files

```
/project-root/
  CLAUDE.md                 # Main entry point
  /.claude/
    /contexts/
      frontend.md          # Frontend-specific context
      backend.md           # Backend-specific context
      database.md          # Database schema/patterns
      testing.md           # Test strategies
    /commands/             # Custom command definitions
    /templates/            # Reusable templates
```

#### 2. Progressive Loading

Start with high-level context, then load specifics:

```markdown
## Quick Context Load Sequence

1. Read CLAUDE.md (always)
2. Check current task in docs/todo/TRACKING/
3. Load relevant context file from .claude/contexts/
4. Read specific code files for task
```

#### 3. Context Switching

Use task-specific context files:

```markdown
# .claude/contexts/frontend.md

## Frontend Development Context

### Tech Stack
- Svelte 5 with runes
- TypeScript
- Vite
- SpacetimeDB SDK

### Key Patterns
- Store pattern: `src/lib/stores/`
- Component structure: `src/lib/components/`
- Route handling: `src/routes/`

### Current Issues
- [List active frontend issues]

### Reference Commands
```bash
npm run dev        # Start dev server

### Example: Database Context

```markdown
# Database Context

## Overview
SpacetimeDB tables and relationships for the Kanban application.

## Key Concepts
- **Row-Level Security**: Visibility filters on queries
- **Reducers**: Server-side functions for data manipulation
- **Subscriptions**: Real-time data sync

## Schema Overview
- `User`: Identity and preferences
- `Board`: Project containers
- `Card`: Task items
- `Collaborator`: Board access control
- `Metric`: Time tracking data

## Common Patterns
### Creating with Relations
```csharp
[Reducer]
public static void CreateCard(ReducerContext ctx, uint boardId, string title) {
    var board = ctx.Db.Board.FindByBoardId(boardId);
    if (board == null) throw new ArgumentException("Board not found");
    
    new Card {
        BoardId = boardId,
        Title = title,
        CreatedBy = ctx.Sender,
        CreatedAt = ctx.Timestamp
    }.Insert();
}
```

## Gotchas & Solutions
1. **Issue**: Subscription filters are global
   **Solution**: Use visibility filters in table definitions

## Commands & Operations
```bash
# Rebuild and publish server
spacetime publish --project-path server kanban-plus

# Check server logs
spacetime logs kanban-plus
```
```

## Limitations and Workarounds {#limitations-workarounds}

### Common Limitations

1. **Context Window Size**
   - **Limitation**: Can't load entire large codebases
   - **Workaround**: Use focused context loading and references

2. **Session Persistence**
   - **Limitation**: Context resets between sessions
   - **Workaround**: Maintain CLAUDE.md and context files

3. **Dynamic State**
   - **Limitation**: Can't track runtime state
   - **Workaround**: Use logging and state dumps

### Effective Workarounds

#### 1. Context Chaining

```markdown
## Context Chain for Complex Tasks

1. Start with CLAUDE.md
2. Load task-specific context
3. Read relevant code files
4. Execute exploratory commands
5. Build mental model
6. Implement solution
```

#### 2. Summary Documents

Create summaries for large components:

```markdown
# Component Summary: CardManager

## Purpose
Manages card CRUD operations and real-time sync

## Key Files
- `card-store.svelte.ts` - State management
- `CardList.svelte` - Display component
- `CardEditor.svelte` - Edit interface

## Dependencies
- SpacetimeDB for persistence
- Svelte stores for reactivity
- DnD library for drag-drop

## Common Operations
1. Create card: `cardStore.create(title, boardId)`
2. Update card: `cardStore.update(id, changes)`
3. Delete card: `cardStore.delete(id)`
```

#### 3. Command Aliases

Create shortcuts for context loading:

```markdown
# .claude/commands/load-frontend.md

Load frontend development context:
1. Read CLAUDE.md
2. Read .claude/contexts/frontend.md
3. List client/src/lib/ structure
4. Show recent frontend commits
```

## Best Practices {#best-practices}

### 1. Keep Context Fresh

- Update CLAUDE.md after each sprint
- Archive old context to .claude/archive/ directory
- Use automated scripts where possible

### 2. Structure for Scanning

- Use clear headers and sections
- Employ bullet points for lists
- Include code examples sparingly
- Highlight key information with **bold**

### 3. Progressive Disclosure

- Start with overview
- Provide details on demand
- Link to comprehensive docs
- Avoid redundancy

### 4. Task-Specific Loading

- Create focused context files
- Load only what's needed
- Reference rather than duplicate
- Clean up after task completion

### 5. Maintain Consistency

- Use standard templates
- Follow naming conventions
- Keep similar structure across files
- Regular maintenance schedule

### 6. Optimize for AI Comprehension

- Clear, unambiguous language
- Logical flow of information
- Explicit rather than implicit
- Examples over abstractions

### 7. Version Control Integration

```bash
# Track context files
git add CLAUDE.md .claude/

# Commit context updates
git commit -m "Update context for sprint 3"

# Tag stable context versions
git tag context-v1.0
```

## Example Workflow

Here's a complete workflow for managing context in a typical development session:

```markdown
