## Technical Requirements

### Server-Side Additions
```csharp
// New tables needed
public struct CursorPosition {
    public Identity UserId;
    public ulong BoardId;
    public float X;
    public float Y;
    public Timestamp LastUpdate;
}

public struct Achievement {
    public Identity UserId;
    public string AchievementId;
    public Timestamp UnlockedAt;
}

public struct BoardTemplate {
    public ulong TemplateId;
    public string Name;
    public Identity Creator;
    public string Configuration;
    public int Stars;
}

// New reducers
[Reducer] UpdateCursorPosition(float x, float y)
[Reducer] UnlockAchievement(string achievementId)
[Reducer] ReactToCard(ulong cardId, string emoji)
[Reducer] StartFocusSession(int minutes)
```

### Client-Side Libraries
- **Physics**: Matter.js for 2D physics
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js for force graphs
- **Audio**: Tone.js for sound effects
- **Drawing**: Fabric.js for canvas
- **Weather**: OpenWeatherMap API

### Performance Considerations
- Cursor updates use separate high-frequency channel
- Physics calculations run on client, sync results
